#Project ideas, escape room.
#Write code here, figure out presentation later.

#Escape room, a puzzle game, text adventure game/coding project. Probably include puzzles n stuff.

# Requirements to remember. 

# The program should use math, conditions, and loops and MUST have a function with variable arguments 
# (and conditions based on the arguments provided) and something involving a list and searching, sorting,
# or iterating through the list (or any similar data structure like a dictionary).

#To decide later: 
#if I want to make this more visual instead of a console.

#inspiration for this is Zork.
#start -> introduce the game, & actions you can take, then 

#lists would be used in checking if an action is doable, items you have. Things activiated.

#first thing to do is create the scenario the escape room is. 
# You awake in a suburban bedroom, the only light comes from a small lamp illuminating the room.
